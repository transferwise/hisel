\section{Research questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
		Given $p$ permutations
	$\sigma^{(1)}, \dots, \sigma^{(p)}$
	in
	$\mathfrak{S}_d$,
	can we give a closed-form formula to compute their radius?
	\item
		Can we give a closed-form formula for the minimal radius of $p$ permutations of length $d$?
	\item
		Can we give an algorithm to construct $p$ well-distributed permutations of length $d$?
\end{enumerate}
